## SEIRS model {#seirs-model}

They use a standard SEIRS Model with mobility from different patches added.


## Well posedness of model {#well-posedness-of-model}

It is fairly easy to show the well posedness of the model by showing the non-decreasing nature of the ODE of the system. The upper bound is shown by summing all equations for S, E, I and R, and showing that dN/dt &le; 0 if N = A/d.
