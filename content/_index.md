Hi! You've come across a stash of random musings that I have started to collect. This contains various things I found interesting, things that I want to read/have read, stackoverflow answers that I used sometime in my life, notes on topics, and other thoughts. I am trying to get into the habit of writing down more of what I keep on thinking. Hopefully this will help with that.
