Well posedness of model It is fairly easy to show the well posedness of the model by showing the non-decreasing nature of the ODE of the system. The upper bound is shown by summing all equations for S, E, I and R, and showing that dN/dt ≤ 0 if N = A/d.</description><content>&lt;h2 id="seirs-model">SEIRS model&lt;/h2>
