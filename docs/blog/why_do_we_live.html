</header><p>
Why do we live? What&rsquo;s our purpose? Is it to just earn money to live flashily? Or do we yearn the feeling of trust and belonging? The feeling of being able to be around people we know and care about. What is this feeling? Where I think that I wish I was alone but also had a support to lean on? A breath that I can count on? Something that, at the end of the day, makes everything else worth it, if not better. I don&rsquo;t know. But I do know that living and being alive are different things and I should learn how to be <i>alive</i>.
