<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Graph databases store data in form of graphs.</li>
<li>Leveraged in use cases that are particularly focused on connectedness within data.</li>
<li>The connections in a graph db data are as important as the data itself.</li>
<li><p>
Example - consider the following tabular data:
</p>

<table>


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left">

<col  class="org-left">

<col  class="org-left">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Name</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Job</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Address</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">Sonya</td>
<td class="org-left">Pilot</td>
<td class="org-left">101 N Main St</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Parker</td>
<td class="org-left">Food Service</td>
<td class="org-left">101 N Main St</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Alex</td>
<td class="org-left">Pilot</td>
<td class="org-left">455 West Ave</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
This table is quite efficient in answering queries like <i>&ldquo;Where does Sonya live?&rdquo;</i> as it can be done via a simple lookup. On the other hand, if we were to ask a question like <i>&ldquo;Who also lives at the same place as Sonya?&rdquo;</i> which is inherently interconnected, then this requires multiple lookups on the table. In this example, we would have to do a lookup to get Sonya&rsquo;s address and then another lookup to get all people with that same address. Such queries can easily get out-of-hand on larger more complex data.
</p>

<p>
To perform the same operation on data stored as a graph, we extract all distinct entities in the data and treat them as nodes. This can require an entire entity resolution process depending on how structured/complex the data is. After extracting unique entities, we create relationship edges between any nodes which share a connection to that record by specifying the <i>type</i> of relationship between the nodes. This allows storing the fact that two entities are related along with <i>how</i> they are related. For the above example, this can look like

</figure>

<p>
Now, to answer the question being discussed, we start by locating the entity in question (Sonya) -&gt; find their address (traversing via the <i>HAS<sub>ADDRESS</sub></i> relationship) -&gt; Follow all other <i>HAS<sub>ADDRESS</sub></i> relationship on that node to find adjacent datapoints.
</p>

<p>
Such queries can be very efficiently executed using GraphQL (Cypher, Gremlin etc.)

<li>Can&rsquo;t these things be done in RDBMS?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yes, but for each relationship extra time/compute needs to be spent to calculate the value of the relationship but graphDB stores it inherently.</li>
</ul></li>
